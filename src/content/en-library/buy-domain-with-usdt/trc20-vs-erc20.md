## Summary

When buying domains with USDT, TRC-20 and ERC-20 are the two most common payment chains, with systematic differences in technical architecture, fee levels, confirmation speed, and cross-chain mistransfer risk. Chain selection directly affects payment cost and order matching success rate—before placing an order, you must confirm the registrar's specified chain, receiving address format, and payment window. Anonymous domain purchase's WHOIS-level privacy protection effect is not affected by chain type, but the traceability of on-chain transfers means that neither TRC-20 nor ERC-20 provides payment-layer anonymity. This page provides a comparative analysis from three dimensions: technical architecture, payment scenarios, and empirical data.

## TRC-20 vs ERC-20 Technical Architecture Comparison

TRC-20 is the TRON network's token standard, implemented based on the TIP-20 specification, with its USDT contract deployed on the TRON mainnet. TRON employs a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, with 27 super representatives producing blocks at approximately 3-second intervals and a theoretical TPS of 2,000. TRC-20 USDT transfers consume TRX as Energy and Bandwidth resources, with the fee structure governed by the TRON network resource model—typically around 1-2 TRX per transfer.

ERC-20 is Ethereum's token standard, implemented via EVM smart contracts, with the USDT contract deployed on the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum currently employs Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus, with block intervals of approximately 12 seconds and Gas fees that dynamically fluctuate with network congestion. ERC-20 USDT transfers require Gas fees priced in Gwei; during congested periods, a single transfer can cost several dollars or more, and even during low-traffic periods fees remain significantly higher than TRC-20.

The two chains have fundamentally different address formats: TRC-20 addresses start with "T" and use Base58Check encoding; ERC-20 addresses start with "0x" and use hexadecimal encoding. This format difference provides an intuitive basis for chain type identification, but it also means that cross-chain mistransfer will result in permanent fund loss, as the contract addresses and state storage on the two chains are completely independent.

## Chain Selection in Domain Payment Scenarios

Chain selection for USDT domain purchases is influenced by both the registrar's technical integration and operational strategy. Registrars supporting crypto payments typically specify accepted chain types and receiving addresses—some support only one chain, while others support both and differentiate via distinct addresses. Users must strictly match the registrar's specified chain type and receiving address; any deviation may prevent the payment from being associated with the order.

Chain selection decisions should consider the following factors: fee sensitivity—for a single domain registration (typically $10-50), ERC-20 peak Gas fees may account for a high proportion of the order amount, giving TRC-20 a clear cost advantage; confirmation timeliness—registrars generally require payment confirmation within a specific window, with TRC-20's 3-second blocks and 19 confirmations (~1 minute) outperforming ERC-20's 12-second blocks and 12 confirmations (~2-3 minutes) in most scenarios; asset distribution habits—users' existing USDT holdings determine the transfer origin, and cross-chain bridging introduces additional costs and trust assumptions; registrar support range—users only have actual choice when the registrar supports both chains.

## Fee and Confirmation Time Empirical Analysis

Based on on-chain data observations from 2025-2026, the two chains' core metrics in domain payment scenarios perform as follows. TRC-20 USDT per-transfer fees have remained stable in the range of 1 TRX (~$0.08-0.12), minimally affected by network congestion, with confirmation times consistently completing within 1-3 minutes. ERC-20 USDT per-transfer Gas fees exhibit wider fluctuation: approximately $0.5-2 during low-congestion periods, reaching $5-15 during high-congestion periods, with confirmation times ranging from 2-5 minutes (normal) to over 30 minutes (extreme congestion).

For domain registration—a typical low-amount, time-sensitive scenario—TRC-20 holds a structural advantage in fee predictability and confirmation time stability. ERC-20's advantages lie in the Ethereum network's security depth and ecosystem maturity, as well as broad compatibility in DeFi and other high-frequency interaction scenarios, but these advantages offer limited marginal contribution in the specific context of domain payments.

## Risk Comparison Table

| Risk Dimension | TRC-20 | ERC-20 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fee Volatility | Low, resource model is stable | High, Gas fees fluctuate sharply with congestion |
| Confirmation Timeliness | 1-3 minutes, stable | 2-5 minutes, significant delays during extreme congestion |
| Cross-Chain Mistransfer Risk | "T"-prefix address format, high recognizability | "0x"-prefix address format, high recognizability |
| Network Security Depth | DPoS 27 nodes, centralization concerns | PoS global validator set, high decentralization |
| Ecosystem Compatibility | TRON ecosystem, fewer DApps | Ethereum ecosystem, rich DeFi/tooling |
| Refund Feasibility | Depends on registrar policy | Depends on registrar policy |
| Privacy Effect | On-chain traceable, no payment anonymity | On-chain traceable, no payment anonymity |

## Compliance Boundaries

This page discusses the technical differences between TRC-20 and ERC-20 in domain payment scenarios in the manner of academic research and reference compilation, and does not constitute investment advice or chain selection recommendations. Users should make decisions based on the registrar's actual support and their own asset distribution. Any attempt to evade regulation or engage in illegal activities is beyond the scope of this discussion.
