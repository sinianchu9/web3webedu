## Summary

Whether KYC is triggered when buying domains with USDT is not determined solely by the payment currency, but by the combined effect of registrar compliance policies, payment gateway anti-money laundering (AML) rules, order amount thresholds, TLD registry requirements, and applicable jurisdiction laws. Anonymous domain purchase does not mean KYC exemption—it refers to WHOIS privacy proxy masking of public registration data, while the registrar may still retain identity information behind the scenes per regulatory requirements. This page systematically analyzes the KYC mechanism in anonymous domain purchase scenarios from three dimensions: legal basis, payment practices, and compliance balance.

## Legal Basis for KYC in Domain Registration

The domain registration system is bound by the ICANN Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA), which requires registrars to collect and verify registrant contact information, including name, mailing address, email, and telephone number. RAA Section 3.7.2 explicitly requires registrars to maintain the accuracy of registration data and provide access upon reasonable inquiry. This obligation constitutes the institutional foundation for KYC in domain registration, independent of payment method.

Under anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) frameworks, jurisdictions impose varying degrees of customer due diligence (CDD) obligations on virtual asset service providers (VASPs). FATF Revised Recommendation 15 brings virtual assets and related services within regulatory scope, requiring VASPs to execute KYC when statutory thresholds are reached or high-risk signals emerge. When USDT domain purchase payments are processed through a third-party gateway, that gateway—if classified as a VASP—must follow corresponding KYC procedures.

Some country-code TLD registries impose additional verification requirements for specific top-level domains. For example, EU member state ccTLDs typically require registrants to provide national identity or proof of address; China's .cn domain enforces real-name authentication under the "Administrative Measures for Internet Domain Names of China"; some national ccTLDs do not conduct prior identity review of registrants. These TLD-level rules operate independently of payment channels and are not waived by using USDT.

## KYC Practices in USDT Payment Scenarios

KYC trigger conditions for USDT domain purchases can be examined from three layers. The first layer is the registrar account layer: most ICANN-accredited registrars require users to submit identity information when creating an account; regardless of the chosen payment method, account-level KYC is completed at the registration stage. The second layer is the payment gateway layer: crypto-supporting payment processors (such as BitPay, CoinPayments, etc.) may execute on-chain transaction monitoring or identity verification when order amounts exceed specific thresholds, based on their own compliance frameworks. The third layer is the registry layer: some TLD registries conduct sampling audits or dispute-triggered reviews of registration data, independent of the payment path.

It is worth noting that in scenarios involving direct payment to a registrar's wallet address, the payment itself does not trigger independent KYC, as on-chain transfers do not require intermediary review. However, the registrant information already held in the registrar's account constitutes a de facto identity record—USDT payment does not create a transaction channel outside the identity system. Therefore, the claim that buying domains with USDT equates to fully anonymous transactions does not constitute an anonymous channel within compliance boundaries and lacks institutional basis.

## Compliance Balance Between Privacy and KYC

In practice, users are concerned about the intersection of privacy protection and KYC obligations. WHOIS privacy proxy services reduce personal information exposure in public queries by substituting proxy information for the registrant's real data—this mechanism is how anonymous domain purchase is implemented at the WHOIS level. However, privacy proxy is not identity elimination: registrars retain registrant's real information per RAA Section 3.7.2 and applicable law, and disclose it to requesting parties upon receipt of valid legal process or UDRP dispute rulings.

The desire for anonymous domain purchase should, within the compliance framework, be understood as minimization of public data exposure rather than evasion of KYC obligations. Reasonable approaches include: choosing registrars that provide WHOIS privacy proxy services, using platforms that support crypto payments with transparent privacy policies, and registering under TLDs that do not require prior identity review. However, none of these measures alter the registrar's obligation to retain and disclose data when legally required.

## Compliance Boundaries

This page discusses the institutional relationship between KYC mechanisms and privacy protection in the manner of academic research and reference compilation, and does not constitute legal advice. Any attempt to evade statutory KYC obligations, escape sanctions, or engage in illegal activities through payment method selection is beyond the scope of this discussion. High-risk business scenarios should obtain professional legal and compliance review in advance.
