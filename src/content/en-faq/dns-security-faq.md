summary: "Frequently asked questions about DNS security governance, covering DNSSEC deployment, DNS hijacking prevention, DNS-over-HTTPS, and regulatory frameworks."
faqs:
-
  question: "What is DNSSEC and why does it matter for domain holders?"
  answer: "DNSSEC adds cryptographic signatures to DNS records, enabling resolvers to verify that responses are authentic and unmodified. It protects domain holders from DNS spoofing and cache poisoning attacks."
-
  question: "Does DNSSEC prevent domain hijacking?"
  answer: "DNSSEC prevents DNS-level spoofing but does not prevent domain hijacking through registrar account compromise. Domain hijacking prevention requires multi-factor authentication and registrar security controls."

## DNS Security Governance FAQ

This FAQ addresses common questions about DNS security governance. For comprehensive coverage, see the [DNS Security Governance research](/en/research/dns-security-governance/).

### DNSSEC

**What is DNSSEC?**

DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) is a suite of cryptographic extensions to DNS that authenticates the origin and integrity of DNS data. It uses digital signatures to enable DNS resolvers to verify that DNS responses have not been tampered with.

**Should all domain holders deploy DNSSEC?**

DNSSEC deployment is recommended for domains where DNS integrity is critical, particularly for financial services, authentication systems, and high-traffic websites. Deployment requires registrar and DNS provider support.
