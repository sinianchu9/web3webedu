faqs:
 - question: "What is USDT?"
   answer: "USDT (Tether) is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, issued by Tether Limited on multiple blockchains including Ethereum, Tron, and BNB Chain."
 - question: "How does Tether maintain the 1:1 peg?"
   answer: "Tether claims each USDT is backed by reserves including cash, cash equivalents, and other assets. The peg is maintained through minting and redemption at $1 per token, though reserve composition has been a subject of ongoing scrutiny."
 - question: "What is the difference between ERC-20 and TRC-20 USDT?"
   answer: "ERC-20 USDT runs on Ethereum with higher gas fees but broad DeFi integration. TRC-20 USDT runs on Tron with near-zero fees and faster confirmation, making it popular for transfers and payments."
 - question: "Can I buy a domain name with USDT?"
   answer: "Yes, several registrars and marketplaces accept USDT as payment. The process involves selecting the correct network, sending the exact amount, and confirming the transaction before the payment window expires."
 - question: "What are the main risks of using USDT?"
   answer: "Key risks include temporary depeg events, sending on the wrong network (loss of funds), transaction timeouts, and regulatory uncertainty around stablecoin issuance and reserves."

## What Is USDT?

USDT (Tether) is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. Issued by Tether Limited, each USDT token is intended to be backed by an equivalent amount in reserves, enabling users to hold and transfer dollar-denominated value on public blockchains without relying on traditional banking rails. Since its launch in 2014, USDT has become the default medium of exchange in crypto trading pairs and is increasingly used for real-world payments, including domain name purchases. For key terminology, see the [USDT Glossary](/en/glossary/usdt/).

## How Tether Maintains the Peg

Tether sustains the $1 peg through a mint-and-redeem mechanism:

- **Minting** — When a verified entity deposits USD (or equivalent assets) with Tether, new USDT tokens are issued on-chain at a 1:1 ratio.
- **Redemption** — Token holders can return USDT to Tether and receive $1 per token, subject to a small fee and verification requirements.
- **Market arbitrage** — If USDT drifts below $1 on exchanges, arbitrageurs buy the discounted tokens and redeem them at par, pushing the price back toward $1.

Tether publishes quarterly attestation reports detailing reserve composition, which includes cash, treasury bills, money-market funds, and other assets. Critics have historically questioned reserve quality, but the peg has held through multiple market stress events with only brief, minor depegs.

## ERC-20 vs TRC-20 vs BEP-20

USDT is issued on several blockchains, each with different characteristics:

| Network | Standard | Avg. Fee | Speed | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| Ethereum | ERC-20 | $2–$15+ | ~12s blocks | DeFi, large transfers |
| Tron | TRC-20 | ~$1 | ~3s blocks | Payments, remittances |
| BNB Chain | BEP-20 | ~$0.20 | ~3s blocks | BSC ecosystem |

For domain payments where speed and low fees matter, TRC-20 and BEP-20 are generally preferred. Always confirm which network the receiving platform supports — sending USDT on the wrong network results in permanent loss. Our [USDT Domain Registration FAQ](/en/faq/usdt-domain-registration-faq/) covers network selection in detail.

## Transaction Flow for Domain Payments

A typical USDT domain purchase follows these steps:

1. **Select domain and payment method** — Choose USDT at checkout and note the supported networks.
2. **Copy the payment address** — The registrar provides a deposit address specific to one network (e.g., TRC-20).
3. **Send the exact amount** — Initiate a transfer from your wallet for the precise invoice total. Underpayment or overpayment may require manual reconciliation.
4. **Wait for confirmations** — Most registrars require 1–6 block confirmations depending on the network before crediting the payment.
5. **Domain activation** — Once confirmed, the domain is registered or transferred to your account.

## Risks to Watch

- **Depeg risk** — Although rare, USDT can temporarily trade below $1 during market panic. Monitor the price before large transfers.
- **Network confusion** — Sending ERC-20 USDT to a TRC-20 address (or vice versa) causes irreversible loss. Double-check both the address and the network.
- **Transaction timeout** — Domain payment invoices typically expire in 15–60 minutes. If the blockchain is congested, your transaction may confirm after the window closes.
- **Regulatory uncertainty** — Stablecoin oversight is evolving globally. FATF and national regulators may impose new compliance requirements affecting availability or redemption. See [Crypto Domain Payment FAQ](/en/faq/crypto-domain-payment-faq/) for regulatory considerations.
