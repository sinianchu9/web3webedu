## Summary

Stablecoins, leveraging price stability and on-chain settlement advantages, are entering domain registration and internet infrastructure payment scenarios. This article analyzes the intersection of stablecoin payments and domain registration, the market status of USDT domain purchases, applicable regulatory frameworks, and core risks, providing research reference for domain holders and payment infrastructure designers.

## Intersection of Stablecoin Payments and Domain Registration

Domain registration fees are characterized by small amounts, low frequency, and a high proportion of cross-border transactions—features that naturally conflict with traditional cryptocurrency volatility. A $10 domain registration paid in BTC could see actual costs deviate from expectations due to exchange rate fluctuations during on-chain confirmation. Stablecoins solve this pain point by pegging to fiat, bringing the price predictability of crypto domain purchases close to credit card payment levels. Additionally, stablecoin on-chain settlement offers three advantages: frictionless cross-border transfer, no bank account threshold, and trackable settlement confirmation—particularly suitable for domain holders in regions with underdeveloped banking infrastructure. USDT on the TRC-20 chain has an average transaction fee below $1 and confirmation times of approximately 1 minute, highly compatible with domain registrars' order timeout windows.

## Market Status of USDT Domain Purchases

As of early 2026, approximately 12 ICANN-accredited registrars support USDT domain purchases, most accessing stablecoin settlement indirectly through third-party payment gateways (such as BitPay, CoinPayments, NOWPayments), with only a few registrars building proprietary on-chain payment modules. TRC-20 commands approximately 75% of on-chain USDT domain payment share due to its low fees and high throughput, ERC-20 accounts for approximately 20%, with the remainder distributed across BEP-20 and other chains. Domain prices are typically denominated in USD, with USDT amounts converted at real-time exchange rates at payment time; registrars complete collection and fiat conversion through custodial wallets or partner gateways. The typical USDT domain purchase flow is: user selects domain → on-chain payment address is generated → user transfers specified USDT amount → on-chain confirmation → registrar system callback confirmation → domain registration becomes effective, completing in approximately 3-5 minutes. Some registrars require KYC before enabling crypto payment channels to comply with anti-money laundering requirements.

## Compliance and Regulatory Framework

Stablecoin domain payments must simultaneously satisfy requirements across both the payment and domain regulatory dimensions. The FATF Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to transmit originator and beneficiary identity information during transfers—in USDT domain purchase scenarios, registrars acting as VASPs must comply with information transmission requirements. The EU MiCA regulation imposes reserve asset and redemption right requirements on stablecoin issuers and e-money tokens (EMT), indirectly affecting stablecoin selection for euro-denominated domain payments. In the US, registrars accepting stablecoin payments must obtain money transmission licenses (MTL) in their operating states and comply with FinCEN anti-money laundering rules. It should be noted that the jurisdictional attributes of non-ICP-filing domains do not affect the compliance obligations of stablecoin payments themselves—regardless of whether a domain requires ICP filing, registrars as payment recipients must comply with virtual asset regulatory requirements in their jurisdiction. The compliance boundaries of cryptocurrency domain purchases depend on the triple jurisdictional overlay of the registrar's place of registration, the payment gateway's license coverage, and the user's location.

## Risk Assessment Table

| Risk Item | Impact Level | Trigger Condition | Mitigation Measures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Irreversible on-chain payment | High | Incorrect or excessive transfer address | Address verification, amount limits, test transfers |
| FATF Travel Rule compliance gap | High | Registrar fails to execute VASP information transmission | Integrate compliant payment gateways, KYC processes |
| Stablecoin depeg | Medium | Reserve asset liquidity crisis | Use multi-currency stablecoin diversification, real-time exchange rate monitoring |
| On-chain confirmation delay causing order timeout | Medium | Network congestion or low Gas fees | Choose low-latency chains like TRC-20, extend timeout window |
| Registrar risk-control account freeze | Medium | Large-value or high-frequency transactions triggering AML alerts | Reasonable transaction frequency, retain payment receipts |
