## Summary

Stablecoins, as crypto assets pegged to fiat currency prices, have deeply penetrated cross-border payments, internet service procurement, and crypto payment gateway scenarios. This article systematically outlines the technical architecture and issuance mechanisms of the three major stablecoins—USDT, USDC, and DAI—analyzes their application paths and compliance constraints in the domain payment field, and assesses the impact of reserve transparency, regulatory frameworks, and systemic risks on stablecoin economic sustainability.

## Research Scope

The total stablecoin market capitalization has exceeded $200 billion, forming a landscape dominated by fiat-collateralized stablecoins with algorithmic stablecoins gradually receding. USDT holds the top market position with over $140 billion in issuance, primarily circulating on the TRC-20 and ERC-20 chains; USDC, issued by Circle, differentiates itself through compliance and transparency, with approximately $40 billion in issuance; DAI, as a decentralized stablecoin issued by MakerDAO, maintains its peg through over-collateralized crypto assets, with approximately $5 billion in issuance. The three exhibit significant differences in collateral models, governance mechanisms, and regulatory adaptability, constituting a representative spectrum of the stablecoin ecosystem.

## Stablecoin Technical Architecture and Issuance Mechanisms

Fiat-collateralized stablecoins support on-chain token value through off-chain reserve assets. USDT and USDC both adopt a 1:1 USD reserve model, but their reserve asset compositions differ: USDT's reserves include a combination of commercial paper, treasury bills, and money market funds; USDC emphasizes US treasury bills and cash as primary reserves and regularly publishes audited reserve reports. Algorithmic stablecoins do not rely on fiat reserves but instead maintain pegs through on-chain arbitrage mechanisms and governance token supply-demand regulation—however, the Terra/UST collapse has demonstrated this model's fragility under extreme market conditions, leading to a significant contraction in algorithmic stablecoin market share.

USDT's TRC-20 and ERC-20 dual-chain deployment architecture reflects stablecoin adaptation strategies across different chain ecosystems. The TRC-20 version leverages TRON network's extremely low transfer fees (~1 USDT) and fast confirmation times, becoming the preferred channel for micropayments and cross-border transfers; the ERC-20 version is deeply embedded in Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem, serving as the core pricing unit for lending, trading, and liquidity provision. While dual-chain architecture expands USDT's coverage scenarios, it also introduces cross-chain bridge security risks and increased on-chain tracking complexity.

Reserve transparency controversy is the core trust challenge facing fiat-collateralized stablecoins. Tether has long faced regulatory scrutiny for insufficient reserve audits, reaching settlements with the New York State Attorney General's Office and the CFTC in 2021, committing to regularly publish reserve composition reports. Circle has adopted a more proactive compliance strategy, obtaining state money transmission licenses across the US and adhering to SEC regulatory frameworks, positioning USDC as a "compliance-first" stablecoin. The choice between these two compliance paths reflects different trade-offs between market share expansion and regulatory adaptation.

## Stablecoin Applications in Domain Payments

In the USDT domain purchase application scenario, users transfer USDT to a registrar-specified address through a crypto payment gateway; the gateway confirms the on-chain transaction and settles fiat currency funds to the registrar's account, completing the domain registration or renewal process. The core advantage of this model lies in bypassing the high fees and multi-day waiting periods of traditional bank cross-border transfers, particularly for users in regions with underdeveloped banking infrastructure. Registrars such as Namesilo and Porkbun now support USDT payments through gateways like BitPay and Coinbase Commerce; in the complete USDT domain purchase flow, from user-initiated transfer to domain activation typically completes within 10 to 30 minutes.

Users purchasing domains with cryptocurrency are often concerned about price stability. Compared to volatile assets like BTC or ETH, stablecoins' fiat pegging characteristic ensures that domain prices do not deviate due to crypto asset price fluctuations during the payment process—the USDT amount paid by the user is essentially equivalent to the USD-priced domain fee. This price stability advantage reduces payment uncertainty and refund risk, making registrars more willing to integrate stablecoin payment channels.

The cross-border payment characteristics of stablecoins lead some users to consider the feasibility of non-ICP-filing domains, but payment method does not change registration compliance requirements. Whether users pay in fiat currency or USDT, registrars must still comply with ICANN accreditation policies and ICP filing regulations in their jurisdiction; for regulated ccTLDs such as .cn, real-name filing is a mandatory registration prerequisite, and changes in payment method do not affect the administrative compliance obligations of domain registration. Stablecoins exist solely as a payment medium and do not confer any special attributes to domains for circumventing filing or identity verification requirements.

## Regulatory Framework and Compliance Requirements

The FATF Travel Rule is the core international framework for stablecoin regulation, requiring virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to transmit originator and beneficiary identity information during transfers. This rule directly impacts on-chain transfers of stablecoins such as USDT: when users use stablecoins through centralized exchanges or compliant payment gateways, relevant transactions must satisfy identity information transmission requirements, and anonymous or pseudo-anonymous transaction paths are restricted. However, decentralized on-chain transfers themselves do not pass through VASP intermediaries—Travel Rule enforcement depends on compliance interception at on/off-ramp points, and on-chain P2P transfers still present regulatory gaps.

The EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) came into full effect in 2024, imposing strict requirements on stablecoin issuers including capital adequacy, reserve isolation, and whitepaper disclosure, and authorizing member state regulators to impose market access bans on non-compliant issuers. In the US, stablecoin issuers must obtain state money transmission licenses (MTL) or federal bank charters, and NYDFS imposes specialized regulation on stablecoins operating within New York State. Circle's USDC has obtained a NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, while Tether has long faced licensing compliance scrutiny—this regulatory分化 is reshaping the competitive landscape of the stablecoin market.

## Risk Assessment Table

| Dimension | Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reserve Risk | Insufficient collateral or liquidity crisis causing depeg | Monitor audit reports, prefer compliant issuers |
| Regulatory Risk | Policy tightening causing stablecoin delisting or usage restrictions | Diversify payment methods, track FATF and MiCA developments |
| On-Chain Risk | Dual-chain cross-chain bridge vulnerabilities, transaction confirmation delays | Choose mainstream chains, confirm receipt before submitting orders |
| Payment Gateway Risk | Gateway failures causing payment non-delivery or refund difficulties | Verify gateway credentials, retain transaction receipts |
| Price Volatility Transmission | Brief stablecoin depeg under extreme market conditions affecting domain pricing | Monitor peg deviation, maintain payment buffer |

## Compliance Boundaries

This article analyzes stablecoin economic impact and its application paths in domain payment scenarios for educational research purposes. The content does not constitute investment, legal, or tax advice. Users employing stablecoins for domain payments should comply with anti-money laundering, foreign exchange management, and tax reporting regulations in their jurisdiction, and must not exploit stablecoin cross-border payment characteristics to evade regulatory审查, escape sanctions, or engage in illegal fund transfers. Business decisions involving large-value or cross-border payments should obtain professional legal and compliance opinions in advance.
