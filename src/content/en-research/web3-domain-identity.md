summary: "Web3 domain identity systems like ENS and Unstoppable Domains offer blockchain-native naming that operates outside ICANN governance, creating both opportunities for decentralized identity and challenges for DNS interoperability."
faqs:
-
  question: "Are Web3 domain names part of the traditional DNS?"
  answer: "Most Web3 domain systems (ENS, Unstoppable Domains) operate outside the traditional DNS hierarchy. They resolve through dedicated smart contracts and require compatible browsers or resolvers, not standard DNS infrastructure."
-
  question: "Can Web3 domains resolve in standard browsers?"
  answer: "Limited support exists. ENS domains can resolve via DNS integration (dnssec.ens.domains) or browser extensions. Unstoppable Domains resolve through partnered browsers. Full native DNS resolution requires ICANN integration."

## Overview

Web3 domain identity represents a paradigm shift in how naming systems operate on the internet. Unlike traditional DNS domains governed by ICANN through a hierarchical delegation model, Web3 domain systems use blockchain smart contracts to manage name registration, resolution, and ownership. This research examines the technical architecture, governance implications, and interoperability challenges of Web3 domain identity systems.

## Architecture Comparison

| Dimension | Traditional DNS | ENS | Unstoppable Domains |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Governance | ICANN/IANA | ENS DAO | Centralized company |
| Name registry | Zone files | Ethereum smart contract | Polygon smart contract |
| Resolution | Recursive DNS resolvers | Smart contract reads | Smart contract reads |
| Expiry model | Annual renewal | Annual renewal (2LD) | One-time payment |
| Interoperability | Universal | Limited (DNS bridge exists) | Limited (partner browsers) |

## ENS Architecture

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is the most established Web3 naming system, operating as a set of smart contracts on Ethereum. ENS supports `.eth` second-level domains with annual renewal fees and integrates with the traditional DNS through DNSSEC verification, enabling DNS domain owners to claim their ENS equivalents.

ENS governance is conducted through the ENS DAO, which controls protocol parameters, fee structures, and treasury allocation through token-weighted voting. This governance model differs fundamentally from ICANN's multi-stakeholder model.

## Compliance Boundaries

This research is presented for educational purposes. Web3 domain systems operate in evolving regulatory environments. Domain holders should understand that blockchain-based naming does not exempt them from applicable laws regarding identity verification, sanctions compliance, or intellectual property rights.
