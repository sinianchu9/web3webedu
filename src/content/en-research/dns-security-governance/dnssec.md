## Summary

DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) provides origin authentication and integrity verification for DNS responses through a digital signature chain, serving as the core protocol-layer mechanism for defending against DNS cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle tampering. This article systematically explains DNSSEC signing chain principles, root zone KSK rollover processes, registry and registrar deployment practices, and current challenges, providing technical reference for domain holders and infrastructure operations personnel.

## DNSSEC Signing Chain Principles

DNSSEC relies on two pairs of keys to build a hierarchical trust chain: the Zone Signing Key (ZSK) is responsible for generating RRSIG signatures for record sets within the zone, while the Key Signing Key (KSK) is responsible for signing the ZSK's DNSKEY record, forming a KSK→ZSK→RRSIG three-level signature structure. The parent zone vouches for the child zone's KSK hash value through DS (Delegation Signer) records; validating resolvers verify from the trust anchor through the DS-DNSKEY-RRSIG chain to the target record. Authenticated denial of existence is implemented through NSEC (directly listing the next record) or NSEC3 (hash-ordered with salt), with the latter preventing zone walking attacks. The entire mechanism is standardized in RFC 4033-4035, establishing three security objectives: data origin authentication, integrity verification, and authenticated denial of existence.

## KSK Rollover and Root Zone Trust Anchor

The root zone KSK is the starting point of the entire DNSSEC trust chain. ICANN generates and stores KSK private keys through the Root KSK Ceremony in offline air-gap systems, with the ceremony witnessed and operation logs signed by multiple Crypto Officers. The current active root zone key is KSK-2017 (RFC 8145 label 20326); KSK-2024 has entered the pre-deployment phase, planned for transition through the dual-KSK rollover process specified in RFC 4035: the new KSK is first introduced into the root zone via co-signing, and the old KSK can only be revoked after validating resolvers update their trust anchors. Rollover failure can cause validating resolvers to reject root zone responses—the 2018 first rollover delay was precisely due to insufficient trust anchor update rates. RFC 8078 and RFC 8145 respectively define DS record automatic push and trust anchor signaling mechanisms to reduce operational risks.

## Registry and Registrar DNSSEC Deployment

Registry responsibilities include root zone and TLD zone signing operations, DS record reception and publication, and periodic signature algorithm upgrades. Registrars must provide DS submission interfaces, allowing domain holders to upload DS records to the registry to complete trust chain对接. NIST SP 800-81 Rev.1 recommends registrars support RSA/SHA-256 and ECDSA P-256 signing algorithms, and implement key rollover automation and signature expiration monitoring. Common deployment defects include: DS record and DNSKEY mismatch, algorithm downgrade attack surface not closed, NSEC3 salt long unupdated, and signature expiration causing zones to become unresolvable. Registries must also address NSEC3 parameter uniformity and zone file signing efficiency impacts on resolution latency.

## Deployment Status and Challenges

As of early 2026, global DNSSEC validating resolver coverage is approximately 85%, but zone signing deployment rates remain significantly low: .com signing rate is approximately 3%, .net approximately 5%, with some ccTLDs such as .nl and .se exceeding 60%. Among common misconfigurations, DS record expiration and key rollover desynchronization account for the highest proportion, approximately 40% of DNSSEC-related failures. It is worth noting that DNSSEC as a protocol-layer security mechanism applies to all domain types, including non-ICP-filing domains—regardless of the jurisdiction and filing requirements where a domain resides, the DNSSEC signing chain provides equivalent response integrity protection. The main deployment barriers remain concentrated in three areas: key management complexity, insufficient availability of registrar DS submission interfaces, and coordination costs of signing algorithm migration.

## Risk Assessment Table

| Risk Item | Impact Level | Trigger Condition | Mitigation Measures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KSK rollover failure | High | Insufficient trust anchor update rate | Pre-deployment co-signing period, RFC 8145 signaling mechanism |
| DS/DNSKEY mismatch | High | DS not synchronized after key rollover | Automated DS submission, registrar interface validation |
| Signature expiration causing zone outage | Medium | ZSK not rotated in time or clock drift | Signature expiration monitoring, redundant signature overlap period |
| NSEC3 zone walking information leakage | Low | Not configured or salt value fixed | Regularly update NSEC3 salt and iteration parameters |
| Algorithm downgrade attack | Medium | Simultaneously supporting weak algorithm signatures | Disable RSA/SHA-1, retain only strong algorithms |
