summary: "DNS hijacking can redirect domain traffic to attacker-controlled infrastructure. Effective prevention combines registrar account security, registry locks, DNSSEC, DNS monitoring, and incident response planning."
faqs:
- question: "Does DNSSEC fully prevent DNS hijacking?"
  answer: "No. DNSSEC can reduce cache poisoning and response tampering risk, but it does not prevent registrar-account compromise or authorized DNS record changes made through a hijacked account."
- question: "What should domain holders prioritize first?"
  answer: "Enable phishing-resistant MFA at the registrar, restrict account access, monitor DNS changes, and evaluate registry-lock support for critical domains."

## Summary

DNS hijacking redirects a domain to infrastructure controlled by an attacker. The impact can include phishing pages, malware distribution, intercepted email, traffic loss, brand damage, and search-index contamination. Prevention requires controls at the registrar, registry, DNS provider, and monitoring layers.

## Attack Paths

Common DNS hijacking paths include cache poisoning, forged DNS responses on hostile networks, registrar-account takeover, compromised DNS hosting accounts, and unauthorized changes to name servers or zone records. The most damaging cases often involve account compromise because the attacker can make changes through legitimate management interfaces.

## Prevention Controls

Domain holders should enable phishing-resistant MFA, restrict registrar account permissions, monitor login and DNS change notifications, and avoid shared credentials. Critical domains should evaluate registry-lock support so changes such as transfers, deletes, and name-server updates require additional verification.

DNSSEC helps validating resolvers detect tampered DNS responses, but it does not protect against an attacker who controls the registrar or DNS hosting account. DNSSEC should be combined with registrar account security, provider-side change approval, and alerting for name-server, DS, MX, and A/AAAA record changes.

## Incident Response

If DNS hijacking is suspected, preserve registrar logs and DNS history, contact the registrar and DNS provider, restore known-good name servers and records, rotate credentials, review DNSSEC keys, and notify affected users when traffic or email may have been redirected.

## Compliance Boundaries

This page is educational research about defensive DNS security. It does not provide instructions for unauthorized access, fraud, phishing, or evasion of registrar, registry, or legal controls.
